## **1. Project Overview**
This project represents a highly secure and efficient enterprise network with its own data center, headquarters, and branch offices. It includes:
- **Data Center** with core routers, ASA firewall, and various servers.
- **Spine-Leaf Topology** to optimize traffic flow.
- **Multiple Security Layers**: NAT, access lists, firewall policies, port security, and wireless security.
- **IoT Integration** with a home network setup for remote management.
- **Routing Protocol**: OSPF configured across the network for dynamic routing.

## **2. Network Design and Architecture**
- **Data Center**: Equipped with primary and standby core routers for redundancy.
- **Firewall**: An ASA firewall is configured to create public, private, and DMZ zones.
- **Spine-Leaf Topology**: Implemented across data center and office structures to reduce traffic congestion.
- **Port Channels**: Configured between firewall and switches for enhanced throughput and reliability.

## **3. Data Center Setup**
The data center architecture includes:
- **Primary and Standby Routers** for high availability.
- **ASA Firewall**: Divides network into three zones:
  - **Public Zone**
  - **Private Zone**
  - **DMZ Zone**: Hosts external servers like DNS, HTTP, SMTP, IoT, NTP, AAA, and Syslog.
- **Internal Servers** in the private zone, such as FTP, internal SMTP, and Radius server.
- **Spine-Leaf Switch Structure** with port channels to improve traffic management.

## **4. Headquarters and Branch Office Structure**
- **Spine-Leaf Topology** replicated in HQ and branches.
- **Devices Used**: Routers, Layer 3 and Layer 2 switches, Access Points, PCs, smartphones, printers, IoT devices, and more.
- **VLANs** and **VTP** for network segmentation.
- **STP** configured on switches to prevent loops and ensure network stability.

## **5. Security Features**
- **Firewall Policies**: Configured on the ASA firewall to control traffic in each zone.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Used for granular control over network access.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Allows secure communication between internal and external networks.
- **Infrastructure Security**: Password-protected devices and SSH for secure remote management.
- **Wireless Security**: Configured WPA2 Personal for secure Wi-Fi connections.

## **6. Routing and Communication**
- **Routing Protocol**: OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) implemented across the network for dynamic routing and efficient communication between network zones.
- **Inter-VLAN Routing**: Configured for secure and segregated traffic flow within the network.

## **7. IoT Integration**
- **IoT Server**: Manages all IoT devices in the network.
- **Home Network (Jack's Home)**: IoT devices in Jack’s home are connected to the IoT server, allowing him to control them remotely from the enterprise network.

## **8. Device and Network Security**
- **Port Security**: Enabled on all switches to prevent unauthorized device connections.
- **Password Protection**: All devices are secured with strong passwords.
- **SSH Access**: Configured on all network devices for encrypted remote management.
- **Firewall Syslog Monitoring**: Logs monitored through a Syslog server connected to the firewall.

## **9. Management and Monitoring**
- **Syslog Server**: Connected to the firewall for tracking network events and logs.
- **Access Control**: Enforced through ACLs and firewall policies to secure sensitive zones.

## **10. Technologies and Protocols Used**
- **Network Devices**: Routers, L3 switches, L2 switches, ASA firewall, various servers (FTP, DNS, HTTP, SMTP, etc.), IoT devices, access points, PCs, smartphones, and more.
- **Protocols**:
  - **OSPF**: Used for dynamic routing.
  - **STP**: Spanning Tree Protocol for loop prevention.
  - **VTP**: VLAN Trunking Protocol for VLAN management.
  - **NAT**: Network Address Translation for secure internal-to-external communication.
  - **WPA2**: Wireless security protocol.
  - **SSH**: Secure Shell for device access.
- **Security**:
  - **Firewall Policies and ACLs**
  - **Port Security** on switches
  - **Wireless Security**: WPA2 Personal for secure Wi-Fi connections.
